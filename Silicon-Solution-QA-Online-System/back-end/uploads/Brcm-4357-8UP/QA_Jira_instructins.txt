Hi Aditya,

Please help build 4 UP station for BRCM 4357 DUT. The four DUTs we have are A1 reference DUT from BRCM. 

FW and HCD file can be found at:
\\lphqfiler1\Public\Business Development\Public\Project\BRCM\BRCM_4357\WIFI_FW\Litepoint_4357a1_REF_IGUANA_REL_13_10_82.zip

\\lphqfiler1\Public\Business Development\Public\Project\BRCM\BRCM_4357\BT_HCD

Below is the bringing up commands. You can put all of them together in to load.sh and run it when setting up. Please note one command is changed.

rmmod dhd
sleep 1
insmod dhd.ko
./dhd -i eth1 download config_pcie_mfgtest.bin bcm94357fcpagbe.txt
sleep 1
./wl interface_create sta -c 1
sleep 1
ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.101 up
sleep 1
ifconfig wl1.2 192.168.3.101 up
sleep 1

You can download the package from:
S:\LitePoint\Silicon_Solutions\engineering_drop\Broadcom_4357\IQfact+_BRCM_4357_MPS_3.4.0.2.zip

Example flow for APT testing is attached. Please note, for RSDB testing, we had added "ant_connection=13,24,13,24" in INSERT_DUT OPTION_STRING. This is to indicate how we connect the DUT.

Please let me know if you have any issue.

Currently, no calibration is supported.

Thanks
Yipeng

Hi Aditya,

Please check attached flow and log.

Instruction for Brix bringing up can be found at \\lphqfiler1\Public\Business Development\Public\Project\BRCM\BRCM_4355\User Manual\4355 Setup instruciton_RSDB and None RSDB.docx

We only have bin folder which supports APT. This is same way as 4360 packages. It is desired behavior.

Please use M16 tester with latest FW 2.7.0. I will check with team on the deadline of the QA.

Thanks
Yipeng

Hi Aditya,
You need to add command "./wl_server_socket &" in the putty console to enable the wl server.
Thanks
