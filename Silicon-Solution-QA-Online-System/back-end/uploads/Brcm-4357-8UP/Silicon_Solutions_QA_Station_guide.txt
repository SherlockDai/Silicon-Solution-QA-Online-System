How to use Kenual log parser tool:
-
You need to copy 
tool exe 
to the base location from where you want to run for the logs. It only parse client 
logs.
-
You 
will have to use Windows to run this since it’s a .exe and won’t be able to run on 
MAC
-
Just run the .exe and no need for additional log as input. it will look for logs and parse them. Also note 
that this tool works on only client log parsing
.
